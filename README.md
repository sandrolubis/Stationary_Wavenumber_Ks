# Stationary_Wavenumber_Ks

In linear dynamics, Rossby waves of stationary wavenumber k are anticipated to be reflected at or decay beyond the turning latitude in which Ks = k. 
Furthermore, Rossby waves are refracted toward values where Ks > k, 
so that regions where Ks is maximized, such as the westerly jets, act as waveguides (Hoskins and Ambrizzi 1993). 

In spherical coordinates, Ks is given by

$K_s=a\cos \phi\left (\frac{\beta_M}{\bar{U}} \right )$

where $\bar{U}$ is a time mean of the upper-tropospheric zonal wind, $\phi$ is the latitude, $a$ is the equatorial Earth radius, $\Omega$ being Earthâ€™s rotation rate and

$\beta_M =\frac{2 \Omega\cos \phi}{a}-\frac{1}{a^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi }\left [ \frac{1}{\cos \phi} \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi } \left ( \bar{U}\cos \phi \right )\right ]$

The zonal wavenumber Ks is the number of zonal waves that would fit around the corresponding local latitude circle.
