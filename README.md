# Stationary_Wavenumber_Ks

In linear dynamics, Rossby waves of stationary wavenumber k are anticipated to be reflected at or decay beyond the turning latitude in which Ks = k. 
Furthermore, Rossby waves are refracted toward values where Ks > k, 
so that regions where Ks is maximized, such as the westerly jets, act as waveguides (Hoskins and Ambrizzi 1993). 

In spherical coordinates, Ks is given by

where $\bar{U}$ is a time mean of the upper-tropospheric zonal wind, ϕ is the latitude, a is the equatorial Earth radius, Ω being Earth’s rotation rate and
